- A built-in Plugin Store with hundreds of free and commercial [plugins](https://plugins.craftcms.com/), all just a click away.
- A robust framework for [module and plugin development](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/extend/).
- An active, vibrant [community](https://craftcms.com/community).

You can learn all about it at [craftcms.com](https://craftcms.com), and documentation is available at [docs.craftcms.com](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/).

## Tech Specs
