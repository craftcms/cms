## About Craft CMS

Craft is a flexible, user-friendly CMS for creating custom digital experiences on the web and beyond.

It features:

- An intuitive, user-friendly Control Panel for content creation and administrative tasks.
- A clean-slate approach to content modeling and [front-end development](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/dev/) that doesn’t make any assumptions about your content or how it should be consumed.
- A built-in Plugin Store with hundreds of free and commercial [plugins](https://plugins.craftcms.com/), all just a click away.
- A robust framework for [module and plugin development](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/extend/).
- An active, vibrant [community](https://craftcms.com/community).

You can learn all about it at [craftcms.com](https://craftcms.com), and documentation is available at [docs.craftcms.com](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/).

## Tech Specs

Craft is a self-hosted PHP 7 application, built on [Yii 2](https://www.yiiframework.com/). It can connect to MySQL and PostgreSQL for content storage. Templating is powered by [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com).
