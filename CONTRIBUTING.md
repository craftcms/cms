Contributing to Craft CMS
=========================

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! We really appreciate it.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Craft CMS and its first party plugins, which are hosted in the [Craft CMS organization](https://github.com/craftcms) on GitHub. These are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in an issue or pull request.

## What to Know Before You Contribute

### Craft isn’t FOSS

Let’s get one thing out of the way: Craft CMS is :smiling_imp:**proprietary software**:smiling_imp:. Everything in this repo, including community-contributed code, is the property of Pixel & Tonic.

That comes with some limitations on what you can do with the code:

- You can’t change anything related to licensing, purchasing, edition/feature-targeting, or anything else that could mess with our alcohol budget.
- You can’t publicly maintain a long-term fork of Craft. There is only One True Craft.

### Code of Conduct

Please take a couple minutes to read through Craft’s [code of conduct](https://github.com/craftcms/docs/blob/v3/en/coc.md). By participating here, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [support@craftcms.com][support].

## Security Disclosures

If you discover a security vulnerability, please review our [Security Policy](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/wiki/Security-Policy), then report the issue directly to [support@craftcms.com][support]. We will review and respond privately via email.

## Bug Reports & Feature Requests

Before submitting bug reports and feature requests, please search through [open issues](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues) to see if yours has already been filed.

If you do find a similar issue, upvote it by adding a :thumbsup: [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Only leave a comment if you have relevant information to add.

If no one has filed the issue yet, [submit a new one](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/new). Please include a clear description of the issue, and as much relevant information as possible, including a code sample demonstrating the the issue.

## Documentation Edits

Craft’s documentation has its own repo, [craftcms/docs](https://github.com/craftcms/docs). Improvements or corrections to them can be submitted as a pull request.

## Control Panel Translations

Craft’s Control Panel translations are located at [src/translations/](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/tree/develop/src/translations) in the repo. You can make translation improvements directly to those files.

## Core Enhancements

If you would like to work on a new core feature or improvement, first suggest the idea on [UserVoice][uservoice] if it’s not there already, and bring up the idea in the `#contribute` channel in [Craft Slack][slack]. As much as we appreciate community contributions, we are pretty selective about which sorts of features should make it into Craft itself rather than a plugin, so don’t take it the wrong way if we advise you to pursue the idea as a plugin instead.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests should clearly describe the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if there is one. If the pull request fixes a bug, it should include a new test case that demonstrates the issue, if possible.

Thanks for being awesome.
