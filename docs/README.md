# About Craft CMS

Craft is a flexible, user-friendly CMS for creating custom digital experiences on the web and beyond.

It features:

- A built-in Plugin Store with hundreds of free and commercial [plugins](https://plugins.craftcms.com/), all just a click away.
- A robust framework for [module and plugin development](extend/README.md).
- An active, vibrant [community](https://craftcms.com/community).

You can learn all about it at [craftcms.com](https://craftcms.com).
