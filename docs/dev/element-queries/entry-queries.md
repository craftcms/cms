# Entry Queries

You can fetch entries in your templates or PHP code using **entry queries**.

::: code
```twig
{# Create a new entry query #}
{% set myEntryQuery = craft.entries() %}
```
```php
// Create a new entry query
$myEntryQuery = \craft\elements\Entry::find();
```
:::

Once you’ve created an entry query, you can set [parameters](#parameters) on it to narrow down the results, and then [execute it](README.md#executing-element-queries) by calling `.all()`. An array of [Entry](api:craft\elements\Entry) objects will be returned.

::: tip
See [Introduction to Element Queries](README.md) to learn about how element queries work.
:::

## Example

We can display the 10 most recent entries in a “Blog” section by doing the following:

1. Create an entry query with `craft.entries()`.
2. Set the [section](#section) and [limit](#limit) parameters on it.
3. Fetch the entries with `.all()`.
4. Loop through the entries using a [for](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/tags/for.html) tag to output the blog post HTML.

```twig
{# Create an entry query with the 'section' and 'limit' parameters #}
{% set myEntryQuery = craft.entries()
    .section('blog')
    .limit(10) %}

{# Fetch the entries #}
{% set entries = myEntryQuery.all() %}

{# Display the entries #}
{% for entry in entries %}
    <article>
        <h1><a href="{{ entry.url }}">{{ entry.title }}</a></h1>
        {{ entry.summary }}
        <a href="{{ entry.url }}">Continue reading</a>
    </article>
{% endfor %}
```

## Parameters

Entry queries support the following parameters:

<!-- BEGIN PARAMS -->

### `after`

Narrows the query results to only entries that were posted on or after a certain date.

Possible values include:

| Value | Fetches entries…
| - | -
| `'2018-04-01'` | that were posted after 2018-04-01.

::: code
```twig
{# Fetch entries posted this month #}
{% set firstDayOfMonth = date('first day of this month') %}

{% set entries = craft.entries()
    .after(firstDayOfMonth)
    .all() %}
```

```php
