# Asset Queries

You can fetch assets in your templates or PHP code using **asset queries**.

::: code
```twig
{# Create a new asset query #}
{% set myAssetQuery = craft.assets() %}
```
```php
// Create a new asset query
$myAssetQuery = \craft\elements\Asset::find();
```
:::

Once you’ve created an asset query, you can set [parameters](#parameters) on it to narrow down the results, and then [execute it](README.md#executing-element-queries) by calling `.all()`. An array of [Asset](api:craft\elements\Asset) objects will be returned.

::: tip
See [Introduction to Element Queries](README.md) to learn about how element queries work.
:::

## Example

We can display a list of thumbnails for images in a “Photos” volume by doing the following:

1. Create an asset query with `craft.assets()`.
2. Set the [volume](#volume) and [kind](#kind) parameters on it.
3. Fetch the assets with `.all()`.
4. Loop through the assets using a [for](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/tags/for.html) tag to create the thumbnail list HTML.

```twig
{# Create an asset query with the 'volume' and 'kind' parameters #}
{% set myAssetQuery = craft.assets()
    .volume('photos')
    .kind('image') %}

{# Fetch the assets #}
{% set images = myAssetQuery.all() %}

{# Display the thumbnail list #}
<ul>
    {% for image in images %}
        <li><img src="{{ image.getUrl('thumb') }}" alt="{{ image.title }}"></li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

## Parameters

Asset queries support the following parameters:

<!-- BEGIN PARAMS -->

### `anyStatus`

Clears out the [status()](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v3/craft-elements-db-elementquery.html#method-status) and [enabledForSite()](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v3/craft-elements-db-elementquery.html#method-enabledforsite) parameters.





::: code
```twig
{# Fetch all assets, regardless of status #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()

    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch all assets, regardless of status
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->anyStatus()
    ->all();
```
:::


### `asArray`

Causes the query to return matching assets as arrays of data, rather than [Asset](api:craft\elements\Asset) objects.





::: code
```twig
{# Fetch assets as arrays #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
    .asArray()
    .all() %}

for Site B.

If this isn’t set, then preference goes to the current site.



::: code
```twig

{% set assets = craft.assets()
    .site('*')
    .unique()

```twig
{# Fetch assets in the volume with an ID of 1 #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
    .volumeId(1)
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch categories in the volume with an ID of 1
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->volumeId(1)
    ->all();
```
:::


### `width`

Narrows the query results based on the assets’ image widths.

Possible values include:

| Value | Fetches assets…
| - | -
| `100` | with a width of 100.
| `'>= 100'` | with a width of at least 100.
| `['>= 100', '<= 1000']` | with a width between 100 and 1,000.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch XL images #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
    .kind('image')
    .width('>= 1000')
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch XL images
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->kind('image')
    ->width('>= 1000')
    ->all();
```
:::


### `with`

Causes the query to return matching assets eager-loaded with related elements.



See [Eager-Loading Elements](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/dev/eager-loading-elements.html) for a full explanation of how to work with this parameter.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch assets eager-loaded with the "Related" field’s relations #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
    .with(['related'])
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch assets eager-loaded with the "Related" field’s relations
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->with(['related'])
    ->all();
```
:::


### `withTransforms`

Causes the query to return matching assets eager-loaded with image transform indexes.

This can improve performance when displaying several image transforms at once, if the transforms
have already been generated.



::: code
```twig
{# Fetch assets with the 'thumbnail' and 'hiResThumbnail' transform data preloaded #}
{% set assets = craft.assets()
    .kind('image')
    .withTransforms(['thumbnail', 'hiResThumbnail'])
    .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch assets with the 'thumbnail' and 'hiResThumbnail' transform data preloaded
$assets = \craft\elements\Asset::find()
    ->kind('image')
    ->withTransforms(['thumbnail', 'hiResThumbnail'])
    ->all();
```
