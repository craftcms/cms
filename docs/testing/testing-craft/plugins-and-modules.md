# Modules & Plugins

## Modules
Setting up modules for testing is quite simple. In your config directory ensure 
an `app.php` is present. Once this file exists you register your Module exactly 
[how you would](../extend/module-guide.md) 
do this for a normal Craft project. Once setup, modules will be loaded in your test suite
and available through the `MyModule::getInstance()` call. 

## Plugins
Plugins must be registered via the `codeception.yml` file in accordance with the
[configuration options](framework/config-options.md#plugins).
Once it is registered the plugin will be installed and available through the 
`MyPlugin::getInstance()` call.
