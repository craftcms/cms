# Codeception
Most of the support that Craft offers for testing is 
provided through [Codeception](https://codeception.com/). 
Craft extends the [Yii2 codeception module](https://codeception.com/docs/modules/Yii2). 

Because of this if you want to run tests using the Craft testing framework you will need
to require `codeception/codeception` in your `composer.json`.

Codeception provides much test related support out of the box including:

- [Complete module and extension support](https://codeception.com/docs/06-ModulesAndHelpers)
- [Code coverage](https://codeception.com/docs/11-Codecoverage)
- [Extending PHP Unit](https://codeception.com/docs/05-UnitTests)
- [Supporting various testing types](https://codeception.com/docs/01-Introduction)
