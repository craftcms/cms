How to Use the Documentation
============================
We created this documentation to accurately record the functionality of Craft with the purpose of helping you understand how to use it to build websites. This documentation is for you.

Most sections of the documentation have detailed examples of how to use the concept we're covering. They are there to help contextualize the Craft feature and make it easier for you to understand how to implement it on your own site.

How you use the documentation will depend on your experience and situation.

## I'm Just Getting Started With Craft

If you're new to Craft and want to get the bigger picture, start with [About Craft CMS](index.md). After that, read through [The Pieces of Craft](the-pieces-of-craft.md) and the [Craft Directory Structure](directory-structure.md). These three pieces of documentation will help you have a better understanding of how Craft works. 

After reading those three items, you can continue on to installing Craft via the [Installation instructions](installation.md).

While getting familiar with the Craft control panel, refer to the Core Concepts section for material on [Sections & Entries](sections-and-entries.md), [Fields](fields.md), and [Templates](templates.md). These will be the first three items you'll encounter in any new Craft-powered website build.

## I'm Moving from Craft 2 to Craft 3

If you're familiar with Craft already but don't know where to start when it comes to moving to Craft 3, start with the [Changes in Craft 3](changes-in-craft-3.md) documentation. This is a comprehensive look at all of the changes made between Craft 2 and Craft 3.

For projects that require upgrading a current Craft 2 project to Craft 3, review the [Craft 2 Upgrade documentation](upgrade.md).

If you are starting a Craft 3 project from scratch, review the [Craft 3 Installation instructions](installation.md). There are new requirements for running Craft 3 and a new installation process, too.
