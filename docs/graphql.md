# GraphQL API

Craft Pro provides an autogenerated [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) API for your content, which you can query to pull your content into separate applications, such as single-page apps (SPAs) or static site generators.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure that you are running Craft 3.3 or later, and you’ve got the Pro edition installed.

### Create Your API Endpoint

The first step to adding a GraphQL API to your project is to set up a public endpoint for it.

To do that, create a [URL rule](routing.md#advanced-routing-with-url-rules) from `config/routes.php` that points to the `graphql/api` controller action. For example, the following URL rule would cause `/api` requests to route to the GraphQL API:

```php
return [
    'api' => 'graphql/api',
    // ...
];
```

You can verify that your endpoint is configured correctly, try sending a `{ping}` query to it.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" -d '{ping}' http://my-project.test/api
```

(Replace `http://my-project.test/api` with the actual URL to your endpoint.)

If that comes back with the following JSON response, then your GraphQL API is up and running!

```json
{"data":{"ping":"pong"}}
```

### Define Your Schemas

Once you’ve created a GraphQL API endpoint, you need to tell Craft which content should be available from it. (No content is available by default.) You do that by defining a **Schema**.

Craft has two types of schemas:

- The **Public Schema** defines which content should be available publicly.
- You can also define multiple private schemas, which each have their own secret **Access Token**.

You can manage your schemas from the Control Panel, at GraphQL → Schemas. In addition to defining the scope of each schema, you can also give them expiration dates, or disable them.

::: tip
When performing a GraphQL API request, the schema will be determined automatically based on the token that is supplied (if any). See [below](#querying-a-private-schema) to learn how to do that.

## Sending API Requests

### Using GraphiQL

The easiest way to start exploring your GraphQL API is with the built-in [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) IDE, which is available in the Control Panel from GraphQL → Explore.

### Using Another IDE

Additional GraphQL IDEs are available as well:

* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
* [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground)
* [GraphQL Playground online](https://www.graphqlbin.com/v2/new)

::: tip
When you are initially exploring the API, make sure that [Dev Mode](config:devMode) is enabled so the IDE can be informed about the entire schema available to it.
:::

### Sending Requests Manually

The GraphQL API can be queried in three ways:

- Using a `GET` request, with the GraphQL query defined by a `query` parameter:
  ```bash
  curl \
    --data-urlencode "query={ping}" \
    http://craft32.test/api
  # or
  curl http://craft32.test/api?query=%7Bping%7D
  ```
- Using a `POST` request with an `application/json` content type, with the GraphQL query defined by a `query` key:
  ```bash
  curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"query":"{ping}"}' \
    http://my-project.test/api
  ```
- Using a `POST` request with an `application/graphql` content type, with the GraphQL query defined by the raw request body:
  ```bash
  curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" \
    -d '{ping}' \
    http://my-project.test/api
  ```

#### Specifying Variables

If you need to specify any [variables](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables) along with your query, then you must send request as a `POST` request with an `application/json` content type, and include a `variables` key in the JSON body alongside `query`.

```bash
curl \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "query": "query($id:[Int]) { entries(id: $id) { id, title } }",
        "variables": { "id": [1, 2, 3] }
      }' \
  http://my-project.test/api
```

#### Querying a Private Schema

The Public Schema will be used by default. To query against a different [schema](#define-your-schemas), pass its Access Token using an `Authorization` header.

```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" \
  -d '{entries{id}}' \
  http://my-project.test/api
```

## Interface Implementation

A defined type exists for each specific interface implementation. For example, if a “News” section has “Article” and “Editorial” entry types, in addition to the `EntryInterface` interface type, two additional types would be defined the GraphQL schema, if the token used allows it: `news_article_Entry` and `news_editorial_Entry` types.

## An example query and response

### Query payload

```graphql
{
  queryEntries (section: "news", limit: 2, orderBy: "dateCreated DESC"){
    dateCreated @formatDateTime (format: "Y-m-d")
    title
    children {
      title
    }
    ... on news_article_Entry {
      shortDescription
      featuredImage {
        url @transform (width: 300, immediately: true)
      }
    }
  }
}
```
