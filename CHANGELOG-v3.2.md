### Added
- All element types now have the option to support drafts and revisions.
- Drafts are now autocreated when content is modified, and autosaved whenever the content changes. ([#1034](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1034))
- Drafts and revisions now store content across all sites supported by the element. ([#2669](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/2669))
- Content previewing is now draft-based, and drafts are stored as specialized elements, so it’s no longer necessary to add special cases in templates for preview requests. ([#1787](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1787), [#2801](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/2801))
- Sections now have a “Preview Targets” setting when running Craft Pro, which can be used to configure additional locations that entries can be previewed from. ([#1489](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1489))
- Sections now have a “Propagation Method” setting, enabling entries to only be propagated to other sites in the same site group, or with the same language. ([#3554](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/3554))
- Matrix fields now have a “Propagation Method” setting, enabling blocks to only be propagated to other sites in the same site group, or with the same language. ([#3554](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/3554))
- Single entries now have editable slugs. ([#3368](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/3368))
- Headless content previewing is now possible by forwarding request tokens off to content API requests. ([#1231](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1231))

- Entry “Share” buttons are now visible on mobile. ([#4408](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/4408))
- Added the “Temp Uploads Location” system setting (available from Settings → Assets → Settings), which makes it possible to choose the volume and path that temporary asset uploads should be stored. ([#4010](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/4010))
- Added the `maxRevisions` config setting. ([#926](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/926))
- Added the `purgeUnsavedDraftsDuration` config setting, which determines how long unsaved drafts should be allowed to exist before getting deleted via garbage collection.

- Relational fields now have a “Validate related elements” setting, which ensures that the related elements pass validation before the source element can be saved with them selected. ([#4095](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/4095))
- Table fields can now have Dropdown, Email, and URL columns. ([#811](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/811), [#4180](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/4180))
- Dropdown and Multi-select fields can now have optgroups. ([#4236](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/4236))
- Date/Time, Dropdown, Lightswitch, Number, and Radio Buttons fields are now listed as sort options in element indexes. ([#2818](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/2818))
- Asset, category, entry, and user indexes can now have “UID” columns. ([#4433](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/4433))
- Added the `unique` element query param, which can be used to prevent duplicate elements when querying elements across multiple sites.
- Added the `preferSites` element query param, which can be used to set the preferred sites that should be used for multi-site element queries, when the `unique` param is also enabled.
- Element index pages are now paginated for non-Structure views. ([#818](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/818))

- Added the `|withoutKey` Twig filter.
- Added the `resave/matrix-blocks` console command.
- The `index-assets/*` commands now support a `--create-missing-assets=0` option, which prevents Craft from creating asset records when they don’t exist yet, and offers an opportunity to fix the location of any asset records that are missing their associated files, when the filename matches one of the files missing an index.
- Added the `mailer/test` command. ([#4020](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/4020))
