### Changed
- Edit User pages will now warn editors when leaving the page with unsaved changes. ([#2832](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/2832))
- Modules are once again loaded before plugins, so they have a chance to register Twig initialization events before a plugin initializes Twig. ([#2831](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/2831))
- `craft\helpers\FileHelper::isSvg()` now returns `true` for files with an `image/svg` MIME type (missing the `+xml`). ([#2837](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/2837))

- Servers without the Intl extension will now use location-agnostic locale data as a fallback if locale data for the specific locale isn’t available.

### Deprecated
- Deprecated `craft\helpers\DateTimeHelper::translateDate()`. `craft\i18n\Formatter::asDate()` should be used instead.

- Removed the `translate` argument from the `|date`, `|time`, and `|datetime` Twig filters; the resulting formatted dates will always be translated now. (Use `myDate.format()` to avoid translations.)

### Fixed
- Fixed an error that could occur in the Plugin Store.
- Fixed a bug where `myDate|date('F')` was returning the short “May” translation rather than the full-length one. ([#2848](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/2848))

### Deprecated
- Many things have been deprecated. See [Changes in Craft 3](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/changes-in-craft-3.html) for a complete list.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where a PHP session would be started on every template rendering request whether it was needed or not. ([#1765](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1765))

### Security
- Craft uses OpenSSL for encryption rather than mcrypt, which is far more secure and well-maintained.
