- Fields on multi-site installs can now be translated per site group.

- Element source definitions can now include `icon` or `iconMask` keys, set to either the path to an SVG file, SVG XML code, or a Craft font icon ligature. (Use `icon` for colored icons; use `iconMask` for masked icons that should change color depending on whether the source is selected.)
- Assets fields and the Assets index page now create a queue runner automatically after new assets are uploaded, in case there are any new jobs that were registered as part of the asset save process.

- Plugin handles must be `kebab-cased` now, rather than `camelCased`. ([#1733](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1733))
- Plugin module IDs are now set to the exact same value as their handles, as handles are already in the correct format now.
- The `maxUploadFileSize` config setting can now be set to a [shorthand byte value](http://php.net/manual/en/faq.using.php#faq.using.shorthandbytes) ending in `K` (Kilobytes), `M` (Megabytes), or `G` (Gigabytes).
- The `allowAutoUpdates` config setting applies to plugins too now.

## 3.0.0-beta.8 - 2017-03-24

### Added
- Added support for a `url` DB config setting, which can be set to a DB connection URL as provided by some PaaS solutions. ([#1317](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1317))
- Added `craft\base\FieldInterface::getIsTranslatable()`.
- Added `craft\base\FieldInterface::supportedTranslationMethods()`.
- Added `craft\base\FolderVolumeInterface::folderExists()`.
- Added `craft\base\Plugin::cpNavIconPath()`.
- Added `craft\base\PluginInterface::getCpNavItem()`.

- Added `craft\elements\Asset::$conflictingFilename`, which stores a record of the attempted filename that ended up conflicting with an existing file.
- Added `craft\elements\Asset::$newFolderId`, which indicates an asset's new intended folder ID.

- Element indexes now have `refreshSourcesAction`, `updateElementsAction`, and `submitActionsAction` settings, which define the controller actions that various Ajax requests should be posted to. ([#1480](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1480))
- Added an `onAfterAction()` method to `Craft.BaseElementIndex`. ([#1534](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1534))
- Plugins can now define [sub-modules](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-structure-modules.html) via `extra.modules` in their `composer.json` file. ([#1559](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1559))
- Elements are now “hard-coded” with their field layout IDs, via a new `fieldLayoutId` column in the `elements` table and a `$fieldLayoutId` property on `craft\base\ElementTrait`. Plugins that provide custom element types should start making sure `$fieldLayoutId` is set on their elements before passing them to `Craft::$app->elements->saveElement()`.

### Changed
- Asset file operations have been refactored to work alongside asset element saving.
- `craft\controllers\AssetsController::actionMoveAsset()` now accepts a `force` param, rather than `userResponse`.
- `craft\controllers\AssetsController::actionMoveAsset()` now returns `conflict` and `suggestedFilename` keys in the event of a filename conflict, rather than `prompt`
- `craft\controllers\AssetsController::actionMoveFolder()` now accepts `force` and `merge` params, rather than `userResponse`.

- `craft\controllers\AssetsController::actionSaveAsset()` no longer accepts `assetId` and `userResponse` params.
- `craft\controllers\AssetsController::actionSaveAsset()` now returns `conflict` and `conflictingAssetId` keys in the event of a filename conflict, rather than `prompt`.
- `craft\elements\Asset` now supports a `create` scenario that should be used when creating a new asset.
- `craft\elements\Asset` now supports a `fileOperations` scenario that should be used when an existing asset’s file is being moved around.
- `craft\elements\Asset` now supports a `index` scenario scenario that should be used when indexing an asset’s file.
- `craft\elements\Asset` now supports a `replace` scenario that should be used when replacing an asset’s file.
- `craft\helpers\Assets::editorImagePath()` was renamed to `getImageEditorSource()`.
- `craft\helpers\Assets::fileTransferList()` no longer accepts a `$merge` argument.
- `craft\services\Assets::createFolder()` now accepts an `$indexExisting` argument that determines whether unindexed folders on the volume should be silently indexed.
- `craft\services\Assets::getNameReplacementInFolder()` now combines the file lists on the volume and the asset index when figuring out a safe replacement filename to use.
- `craft\services\Assets::getNameReplacementInFolder()` now throws an `InvalidParamException` if `$folderId` is set to an invalid folder ID.
- `craft\services\Assets::moveAsset()` now accepts an instance of `craft\models\VolumeFolder` instead of a folder ID.
- `craft\services\Assets::moveAsset()` now returns a boolean value.
- The `cacheDuration`, `cooldownDuration`, `defaultTokenDuration`, `elevatedSessionDuration`, `invalidLoginWindowDuration`, `purgePendingUsersDuration`, `rememberUsernameDuration`, `rememberedUserSessionDuration`, `userSessionDuration`, and `verificationCodeDuration` config settings can now be set to an integer (number of seconds), string ([duration interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations)), or `DateInterval` object.
- Plugin config file values in `config/pluginhandle.php` are now merged with database-stored plugin settings, and applied to the plugin’s settings model. (Also removed support for plugin `config.php` files.) ([#1096](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1096))
- `craft\services\Config::getConfigSettings()` now only accepts a `$category` value of `apc`, `db`, `dbcache`, `filecache`, `general`, or `memcache`. (It no longer accepts plugin handles.)
- Renamed `craft\base\PluginTrait::$hasSettings` to `$hasCpSettings`.
- Removed support for automatically determining the values for the `omitScriptNameInUrls` and `usePathInfo` config settings.
- Removed support for `@web`, `@webroot`, and other aliases in volume settings, as they cause more problems than they solve in multi-site Craft installs.
- Local volumes’ “File System Path” settings can now begin with `@webroot`, which is an alias for the path to the directory that `index.php` lives in.
- `craft\base\Element::getFieldLayout()` now returns a field layout based on the `$fieldLayoutId` property (if set). It no longer returns the first field layout associated with the static element class.
- `craft\services\Fields::assembleLayoutFromPost()` now sets the ID on the returned field layout if the post data came from a Field Layout Designer for an existing field layout.
- `craft\services\Fields::saveLayout()` is now capable of updating existing field layouts, not just creating new ones. So there’s no longer a need to delete the old field layout and save a brand new one each time something changes.
- Field types that don’t support a column in the `content` table are no longer assumed to be untranslatable. If a field type wants to opt out of having a Translation Method setting, it should override its static `supportedTranslationMethods()` method and return either `['none']` or `['site']`, depending on whether its values should be propagated across other sites or not.

- Renamed Plain Text fields’ “Max Length” setting to “Character Limit”.

### Changed
- The bootstrap script now assumes that the `vendor/` folder is 3 levels up from the `bootstrap/` directory by default (e.g. `vendor/craftcms/cms/bootstrap/`). If that is not the case (most likely because Craft had been symlinked into place), the `CRAFT_VENDOR_PATH` PHP constant can be used to correct that.
- The default `port` DB config value is now either `3306` (if MySQL) or `5432` (if PostgreSQL).
- The default `tablePrefix` DB config value is now empty.
- Renamed the `defaultFilePermissions` config setting to `defaultFileMode`, and it is now `null` by default.
- Renamed the `defaultFolderPermissions` config setting to `defaultDirMode`.
- Renamed the `useWriteFileLock` config setting to `useFileLocks`.
- Renamed the `backupDbOnUpdate` config setting to `backupOnUpdate`. Note that performance should no longer be a major factor when setting this to false, since the backup is no longer generated by PHP.
- Renamed the `restoreDbOnUpdateFailure` config setting to `restoreOnUpdateFailure`.
- File-based data caching now respects the `defaultDirMode` config setting.
- Redactor config files must now be valid JSON.
- When a category is deleted, its nested categories are no longer deleted with it.
- Craft Personal and Client editions are now allowed to have custom Volume types (e.g. Amazon S3).
- Renamed the “Get Help” widget to “Craft Support”.
- When editing a field whose type class cannot be found, Craft will now select Plain Text as a fallback and display a validation error on the Field Type setting.
- When editing a volume whose type class cannot be found, Craft will now select Local as a fallback and display a validation error on the Volume Type setting.
- When editing email settings and the previously-selected transport type class cannot be found, Craft will now select PHP Mail as a fallback and display a validation error on the Transport Type setting.
- The Feed widget is now limited to show 5 articles by default.
- Element queries’ `status` params must now always be set to valid statuses, or the query won’t return any results.
- Craft now relies on command line tools to create database backups (`mysqldump` and `pg_dump`).
- Test emails now mask the values for any Mailer transport type settings that include “key” or “password” in their setting name.
- The Control Panel page header is now fixed when scrolling down.
- Translatable fields are no longer marked as translatable when editing an element type that isn’t localizable (e.g. user accounts).
- Custom email messages are now stored on o per-language basis rather than per-site basis.
- Element indexes now remember which sources were expanded across multiple requests.
- Element indexes now remember if a nested source was selected across multiple requests.
- Plugin schema versions now default to `'1.0.0'`, and plugins absolutely must increment their schema version if they want any pending migrations to be noticed.
- Resource requests no longer serve files within Craft’s or plugins’ `resources/` folders.
- Renamed the `{% registercss %}` Twig tag to `{% css %}`.
- Renamed the `{% registerjs %}` Twig tag to `{% js %}`.

- `craft\elements\User` now supports a `password` validation scenario, which only validates the `$newPassword` property.
- `craft\elements\User` now supports a `registration` validation scenario, which only validates the `$username`, `$email`, and `$newPassword` properties.
- It is no longer possible to change a user’s locked/suspended/pending/archived status when saving the User element normally.
- `craft\elements\db\MatrixBlockQuery::owner()` and `ownerSiteId()` now set the `$siteId` property when appropriate.
- The source keys that are passed into element methods’ `$source` arguments now reflect the full path to the source, if it is a nested source (e.g. `folder:1/folder:2`).
- The `Craft.publishableSections` Javascript array now includes info about each section’s entry types.
- `craft\db\Connection::backup()` now throws an exception if something goes wrong, rather than returning `true` or `false`. If no exception is thrown, it worked.

- `craft\elements\User::getAuthor()` now throws a `yii\base\InvalidConfigException` if its `$authorId` property is set to an invalid user ID.
- `craft\elements\User::getPhoto()` now throws a `yii\base\InvalidConfigException` if its `$photoId` property is set to an invalid asset ID.
- `craft\models\FieldLayoutTab::getLayout()` now throws a `yii\base\InvalidConfigException` if its `$layoutId` property is set to an invalid field layout ID.

- Added `craft\base\ElementInterface::getFieldValues()`, replacing `getContent()`.
- Added `craft\base\ElementInterface::setFieldValues()`, replacing `setContent()`.
- Added `craft\base\ElementInterface::setFieldValuesFromPost()`, replacing `setContentFromPost()`.
- Added `craft\base\ElementInterface::setRawPostValueForField()`, replacing `setRawPostContent()`.
- Added `craft\base\ElementInterface::setFieldValue()`.
- All `$value` arguments on Field methods are now set to the prepared field value, with the sole exception of `prepareValue()`.
- Added `craft\base\FieldInterface::prepareValueForDb()`, giving fields direct control over how their values should be saved to the database, without affecting the value stored on the element. (This replaces the protected `prepareValueBeforeSave()` method.)
- Added protected `craft\base\Field::isValueEmpty()` which aids `craft\base\Field::validateValue()` in required-field validation.
- Added `craft\helpers\DateTimeHelper::normalizeTimeZone()`.
- Added `craft.getTimeZone()` for Control Panel JavaScript.
- Added the `craft\craft\app\base\Savable` interface. Objects that implement it have control over how `craft\helpers\DbHelper::prepareValueForDb()` prepares them to be saved to the database.
- Added `craft\craft\app\web\View::getBodyHtml()`, replacing `getBodyBeginHtml()` and `getBodyEndHtml()`.

### Changed
- Updated Yii to 2.0.5.
- Element queries are no longer limited to 100 results by default.
- `craft\elements\db\ElementQuery::count()` now returns the total cached results, if set.
- `craft\base\FieldInterface::validateValue()` is now responsible for required-field validation (and a basic is-empty check is included in `craft\base\Field`).
- `craft\base\FieldInterface::validateValue()` no longer needs to return `true` if the value passed validation.
- `craft\dates\DateTimeHelper::toDateTime()`’s `$timezone` argument has been replaced with `$assumeSystemTimeZone`. If set to `true` and if `$value` doesn’t have an explicit time zone, the method will use the system’s time zone. Otherwise UTC will be used. (Defaults to `false`.)
- `craft\dates\DateTimeHelper::toDateTime()` now checks for a `timezone` key when `$value` is in the date/time-picker array format.
- `craft\dates\DateTimeHelper::toDateTime()` now returns `false` instead of `null` when an array without `'date'` or `'time'` keys is passed in.
- `craft\dates\DateTime::createFromFormat()` no longer sets the `$timezone` argument if left null, matching the base `DateTime` class’s behavior.
- Date/time-pickers in the CP now explicitly declare that they are using the system time zone in their post data.
- Nested database transactions will now set savepoints within the master transaction, as MySQL doesn’t support nested transactions.
- `PluginClassName::getInstance()` will now return the singular instance of the plugin class.

### Removed
- Removed `craft\dates\DateTime::format()`, so it no longer has a `$timezone` argument and automatically sets the time zone on the `DateTime` object.

### Fixed
- Fixed many, many bugs.

## 3.0.0-alpha.2671 - 2015-06-18

### Added
- Ported all new features and improvements that were introduced in [Craft 2.4](http://buildwithcraft.com/updates#build2664).
- The codebase now follows the [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) coding style.
- Added support for `config/app.php`, which can return an array that will be merged with Craft’s core application config array.
- Craft now looks for translation files at `translations/locale-ID/category.php`, where `category` can either be `'app'`, `'site'`, `'yii'`, or a plugin’s handle.
- All user-defined strings in the Control Panel (e.g. section names) are now translated using the `'site'` category, to prevent translation conflicts with Craft’s own Control Panel translations.
- Craft now uses SwiftMailer to send emails.
- Added the ability for plugins to provide custom SwiftMailer transport options.
- Added `craft\helpers\DateTimeHelper::toIso8601()`, for converting a date (or date-formatted string) into an ISO-8601-formatted string.
- Added `craft\helpers\DateTimeHelper::isIso8601()`, for determining if a given variable is an ISO-8601-formatted string.
- Added `craft\helpers\DateTimeHelper::translateDate()`, for translating month and weekday names from English to the active application language.
- Added `craft\helpers\DbHeleper::prepareDateForDb()`, which replaces the old `craft\helpers\DateTimeHelper::formatTimeForDb()`.
- Added `craft\behaviors\FieldLayoutBehavior`, which replaces `craft\base\FieldLayoutTrait`, enabling a single class to have more than one field layout associated with it.
- The localized date format used by JavaScript date pickers is now available from `Craft.datepickerFormat`.
- Added the JavaScript method, `Craft.formatDate()`, for formatting a date (or date-formatted string) into a string using the same localized date format used by JavaScript date pickers.

### Changed
- The `translationDebugOutput` config setting will now wrap strings with `@` characters if the category is `'app'`, `$` if the category is `'site'`, and `%` for anything else.
- Web requests are now logged to `storage/logs/web.log`.
- Web requests that result in 404 errors are now logged to `storage/logs/web-404s.log`.
- Console requests are now logged to `storage/logs/console.log`.
- Template error handling now works similarly to how it does in Craft 2 when Craft is running in Dev Mode, where the template source is shown in the error view.
- Twig class names now link to their respective class reference URLs in the error view’s stack trace.
- The `registercss`, `registerhirescss`, and `registerjs` tags can now be used as tag pairs.
- The `registerassetbundle`, `registerjs`, `registerjsfile`, and `registerjsresource` tags now support an `at` param for specifying the location on the page their HTML tags should be placed. (Possible values are `at head`, `at beginBody`, and `at endBody`.)
- The `registerjs` tag now supports an `on` param for specifying when the JavaScript code should be executed. (Possible values are `on ready` and `on load`.) (The `at` and `on` parameters are mutually exclusive.)
- The `registercss`, `registerhirescss`, `registercssfile`, `registercssresource`, `registerjsfile`, and `registerjsresource` tags now support a `with` param, which can be set to an object that specifies additional attributes on the resulting tags (e.g. `with { rel: "stylesheet" }`).
- The `t` filter now always defaults to translating the given string using the `'site'` category unless it is otherwise specified (e.g. `myString|t('pluginhandle')`).
- `@craft/plugins/pluginhandle` aliases are now registered _before_ Craft attempts to load a plugin’s primary class, making it easier for plugins to use custom class names.
- `craft\base\Model::toArray()` now converts `DateTime` attributes to ISO-8601 strings.
- Renamed `craft\helpers\AssetHelper::cleanAssetName()` to `prepareAssetName()`.
- Renamed `craft\helpers\DbHelper::prepObjectValues()` to `prepareValuesForDb()`.
- Renamed `craft\helpers\DbHelper::prepValue()` to `prepareValueForDb()`.
- Renamed `craft\events\Event::$performAction` to `$isValid` to be consistent with Yii events.
- `craft\helpers\DateTimeHelper::toDateTime()` will now return `false` if it is unable to convert `$object` to a `DateTime` object.
- `craft\helpers\DateTimeHelper::toDateTime()` now supports ISO-8601-formatted dates.
- `craft\helpers\DbHelper::prepareValueForDb()` now treats ISO-8601 strings as dates, and converts them to the MySQL date format.

### Deprecated
- All the new `register*` tags must be all-lowercase now. (The old `include*` tags still work as they do in Craft 2, however they remain deprecated.)
