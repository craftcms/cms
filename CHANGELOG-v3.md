### Unreleased

### Changed
- `craft\i18n\Formatter::asText` will now format DateTime objects to text.

- The `cacheDuration` config setting can now be set to an integer (number of seconds).
- `craft\mail\Mailer::send()` now returns `false` if the message couldn’t be sent, rather than throwing a `SendEmailException`.

- Fixed a bug where entries’ “Title” field would receive two identical validation errors if a brand new entry was immediately saved as a draft, and didn’t have a title yet.

- Craft now supports installing plugins via Composer, with the help [Craft CMS Composer Installer](https://github.com/craftcms/plugin-installer).
- Craft now checks for plugin info in a composer.json file, rather than plugin.json, for plugins that were manually installed in `plugins/`. (See the [Craft CMS Composer Installer](https://github.com/craftcms/plugin-installer) readme for details on how the info should be formatted.)

### Changed
- The bootstrap script now assumes that the `vendor/` folder is 3 levels up from the `bootstrap/` directory by default (e.g. `vendor/craftcms/cms/bootstrap/`). If that is not the case (most likely because Craft had been symlinked into place), the `CRAFT_VENDOR_PATH` PHP constant can be used to correct that.
- The default `port` DB config value is now either `3306` (if MySQL) or `5432` (if PostgreSQL).
- The default `tablePrefix` DB config value is now empty.
- Renamed the `defaultFilePermissions` config setting to `defaultFileMode`, and it is now `null` by default.
- Renamed the `defaultFolderPermissions` config setting to `defaultDirMode`.
- Renamed the `useWriteFileLock` config setting to `useFileLocks`.
- Renamed the `backupDbOnUpdate` config setting to `backupOnUpdate`. Note that performance should no longer be a major factor when setting this to false, since the backup is no longer generated by PHP.
- Renamed the `restoreDbOnUpdateFailure` config setting to `restoreOnUpdateFailure`.
- File-based data caching now respects the `defaultDirMode` config setting.
- Redactor config files must now be valid JSON.
- When a category is deleted, its nested categories are no longer deleted with it.
- Craft Personal and Client editions are now allowed to have custom Volume types (e.g. Amazon S3).
- Renamed the “Get Help” widget to “Craft Support”.
- When editing a field whose type class cannot be found, Craft will now select Plain Text as a fallback and display a validation error on the Field Type setting.
- When editing a volume whose type class cannot be found, Craft will now select Local as a fallback and display a validation error on the Volume Type setting.
- When editing email settings and the previously-selected transport type class cannot be found, Craft will now select PHP Mail as a fallback and display a validation error on the Transport Type setting.
- The Feed widget is now limited to show 5 articles by default.
- Element queries’ `status` params must now always be set to valid statuses, or the query won’t return any results.
- Craft now relies on command line tools to create database backups (`mysqldump` and `pg_dump`).
- Test emails now mask the values for any Mailer transport type settings that include “key” or “password” in their setting name.
- The Control Panel page header is now fixed when scrolling down.
- Translatable fields are no longer marked as translatable when editing an element type that isn’t localizable (e.g. user accounts).
- Custom email messages are now stored on o per-language basis rather than per-site basis.
- Element indexes now remember which sources were expanded across multiple requests.
- Element indexes now remember if a nested source was selected across multiple requests.

- Renamed the `{% registercss %}` Twig tag to `{% css %}`.
- Renamed the `{% registerjs %}` Twig tag to `{% js %}`.

- `craft\elements\db\MatrixBlockQuery::owner()` and `ownerSiteId()` now set the `$siteId` property when appropriate.
- The source keys that are passed into element methods’ `$source` arguments now reflect the full path to the source, if it is a nested source (e.g. `folder:1/folder:2`).
- The `Craft.publishableSections` Javascript array now includes info about each section’s entry types.
- `craft\db\Connection::backup()` now throws an exception if something goes wrong, rather than returning `true` or `false`. If no exception is thrown, it worked.

## 3.0.0-alpha.2915 - 2016-08-17

### Added
- User photos are now assets. (Note that the `storage/userphotos/` folder must be manually moved to a publicly accessible location, and the User Photos asset volume’s settings must be updated accordingly, for user photos to work properly.)
- Added `craft\elements\User::getPhoto()`, which returns the user’s photo asset, if they have one.
- Added `craft\helpers\StringHelper::randomStringWithChars()`.

### Changed
- All `redirect` params must now be hashed using the `|hash` filter (e.g. `<input type="hidden" name="redirect" value="{{ 'foo'|hash }}">`). A new `redirectInput()` global function makes this a little easier (e.g. `{{ redirectInput('foo') }}`).
- Ported recent changes from Craft 2.
- The `getCsrfInput()` global function has been renamed to `csrfInput()`. (getCsrfInput() still works but produces a deprecation error.)
- The `|hash` filter no longer requires a `$key` argument.
- Brought back `getId()`, `getName()`, and `getNativeName()` methods to Locale, so Craft 2 templates don’t need to be updated right away, although they will produce a deprecation error.

- Fixed a few bugs related to saving elements on localized sites.
- Fixed tag group saving and deleting.

## 3.0.0-alpha.2681 - 2015-07-22

### Added
- Ported all improvements and bug fixes from the latest Craft 2.4 builds.
- Added the `enableCsrfCookie` config setting, which determines whether CSRF tokens should be saved in cookies. Defaults to `true`. CSRF tokens will be stored in the PHP session if set to `false`.
- The Content model has been removed. Elements now have `craft\behaviors\ContentBehavior`s directly. Because speed!
- Added `craft\base\ElementTrait::$contentId` for storing the content row’s ID.

- Added `craft\base\ElementInterface::setFieldValue()`.
- All `$value` arguments on Field methods are now set to the prepared field value, with the sole exception of `prepareValue()`.
- Added `craft\base\FieldInterface::prepareValueForDb()`, giving fields direct control over how their values should be saved to the database, without affecting the value stored on the element. (This replaces the protected `prepareValueBeforeSave()` method.)

- Added `craft\helpers\DateTimeHelper::normalizeTimeZone()`.
- Added `craft.getTimeZone()` for Control Panel JavaScript.

- `craft\base\FieldInterface::validateValue()` no longer needs to return `true` if the value passed validation.
- `craft\dates\DateTimeHelper::toDateTime()`’s `$timezone` argument has been replaced with `$assumeSystemTimeZone`. If set to `true` and if `$value` doesn’t have an explicit time zone, the method will use the system’s time zone. Otherwise UTC will be used. (Defaults to `false`.)
- `craft\dates\DateTimeHelper::toDateTime()` now checks for a `timezone` key when `$value` is in the date/time-picker array format.
- `craft\dates\DateTimeHelper::toDateTime()` now returns `false` instead of `null` when an array without `'date'` or `'time'` keys is passed in.
- `craft\dates\DateTime::createFromFormat()` no longer sets the `$timezone` argument if left null, matching the base `DateTime` class’s behavior.
- Date/time-pickers in the CP now explicitly declare that they are using the system time zone in their post data.
- Nested database transactions will now set savepoints within the master transaction, as MySQL doesn’t support nested transactions.
- `PluginClassName::getInstance()` will now return the singular instance of the plugin class.

### Removed
- Removed `craft\dates\DateTime::format()`, so it no longer has a `$timezone` argument and automatically sets the time zone on the `DateTime` object.

### Fixed
- Fixed many, many bugs.

## 3.0.0-alpha.2671 - 2015-06-18

### Added
- Ported all new features and improvements that were introduced in [Craft 2.4](http://buildwithcraft.com/updates#build2664).
- The codebase now follows the [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) coding style.
- Added support for `config/app.php`, which can return an array that will be merged with Craft’s core application config array.
- Craft now looks for translation files at `translations/locale-ID/category.php`, where `category` can either be `'app'`, `'site'`, `'yii'`, or a plugin’s handle.
- All user-defined strings in the Control Panel (e.g. section names) are now translated using the `'site'` category, to prevent translation conflicts with Craft’s own Control Panel translations.
- Craft now uses SwiftMailer to send emails.
- Added the ability for plugins to provide custom SwiftMailer transport options.
- Added `craft\helpers\DateTimeHelper::toIso8601()`, for converting a date (or date-formatted string) into an ISO-8601-formatted string.

- Added `craft\helpers\DateTimeHelper::translateDate()`, for translating month and weekday names from English to the active application language.
- Added `craft\helpers\DbHeleper::prepareDateForDb()`, which replaces the old `craft\helpers\DateTimeHelper::formatTimeForDb()`.
- Added `craft\behaviors\FieldLayoutBehavior`, which replaces `craft\base\FieldLayoutTrait`, enabling a single class to have more than one field layout associated with it.
- The localized date format used by JavaScript date pickers is now available from `Craft.datepickerFormat`.
- Added the JavaScript method, `Craft.formatDate()`, for formatting a date (or date-formatted string) into a string using the same localized date format used by JavaScript date pickers.

### Changed
- The `translationDebugOutput` config setting will now wrap strings with `@` characters if the category is `'app'`, `$` if the category is `'site'`, and `%` for anything else.
- Web requests are now logged to `storage/logs/web.log`.
- Web requests that result in 404 errors are now logged to `storage/logs/web-404s.log`.
- Console requests are now logged to `storage/logs/console.log`.
- Template error handling now works similarly to how it does in Craft 2 when Craft is running in Dev Mode, where the template source is shown in the error view.
- Twig class names now link to their respective class reference URLs in the error view’s stack trace.
- The `registercss`, `registerhirescss`, and `registerjs` tags can now be used as tag pairs.
- The `registerassetbundle`, `registerjs`, `registerjsfile`, and `registerjsresource` tags now support an `at` param for specifying the location on the page their HTML tags should be placed. (Possible values are `at head`, `at beginBody`, and `at endBody`.)
- The `registerjs` tag now supports an `on` param for specifying when the JavaScript code should be executed. (Possible values are `on ready` and `on load`.) (The `at` and `on` parameters are mutually exclusive.)
- The `registercss`, `registerhirescss`, `registercssfile`, `registercssresource`, `registerjsfile`, and `registerjsresource` tags now support a `with` param, which can be set to an object that specifies additional attributes on the resulting tags (e.g. `with { rel: "stylesheet" }`).
- The `t` filter now always defaults to translating the given string using the `'site'` category unless it is otherwise specified (e.g. `myString|t('pluginhandle')`).
- `@craft/plugins/pluginhandle` aliases are now registered _before_ Craft attempts to load a plugin’s primary class, making it easier for plugins to use custom class names.
- `craft\base\Model::toArray()` now converts `DateTime` attributes to ISO-8601 strings.
- Renamed `craft\helpers\AssetHelper::cleanAssetName()` to `prepareAssetName()`.
- Renamed `craft\helpers\DbHelper::prepObjectValues()` to `prepareValuesForDb()`.
- Renamed `craft\helpers\DbHelper::prepValue()` to `prepareValueForDb()`.
- Renamed `craft\events\Event::$performAction` to `$isValid` to be consistent with Yii events.
- `craft\helpers\DateTimeHelper::toDateTime()` will now return `false` if it is unable to convert `$object` to a `DateTime` object.
- `craft\helpers\DateTimeHelper::toDateTime()` now supports ISO-8601-formatted dates.
- `craft\helpers\DbHelper::prepareValueForDb()` now treats ISO-8601 strings as dates, and converts them to the MySQL date format.
