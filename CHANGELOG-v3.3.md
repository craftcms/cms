# Running Release Notes for Craft CMS 3.3

## Changed
- You can now use handles in Global set reference tags. ([#4645](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/4645))
- Improved the `svg()` function to allow custom attributes and elements. ([#4660](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/4660), [#3937](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/3937))

## Deprecated
- You can no longer pass a `string $class` argument to the twig svg function. Pass `array $attributes` instead.
