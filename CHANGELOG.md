### Changed
- Craft now requires PHP 8.0.2 or later.
- Craft now requires MySQL 5.7.8 / MariaDB 10.2.7 / PostgreSQL 10.0 or later.
- Craft now requires the [Intl](https://php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php) and [BCMath](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php) PHP extensions.
- Improved draft creation/application performance. ([#10577](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/10577))

- Users are no longer required to have a username or email.
- Users can now set their Formatting Locale to any known locale; not just the available Language options. ([#10519](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/10519))
- Users’ Language and Formatting Locale settings now display locale names in the current language and their native languages. ([#10519](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/10519))
- User queries now return all users by default, rather than only active users.
- Filtering users by `active`, `pending`, and `locked` statuses no longer excludes suspended users.

- `alt` is now a reserved field handle for volume field layouts.
- Volumes no longer have “types”, and their file operations are now delegated to a filesystem selected by an “Asset Filesystem” setting on the volume.

- Path options passed to console commands (e.g. `--basePath`) now take precedence over their enivronment variable/PHP constant counterparts.
- Database backups are now named after the Craft version in the database, rather than the Composer-installed version. ([#9733](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/9733))
- Template autosuggestions now include their filename. ([#9744](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/9744))
- Improved the look of loading spinners in the control panel. ([#9109](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/9109))

- Removed the `siteName` config setting. Environment-specific site names can be defined via environment variables.
- Removed the `siteUrl` config setting. Environment-specific site URLs can be defined via environment variables.
- Removed the `suppressTemplateErrors` config setting.
- Removed the `useCompressedJs` config setting.
- Removed the `useProjectConfigFile` config setting. Override `craft\services\ProjectConfig::$writeYamlAutomatically` to opt into [manual YAML file generation](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/project-config.html#manual-yaml-file-generation).

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where pending project config changes in the YAML would get applied when other project config changes were made. ([#9660](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/9660))
- Fixed a bug where revisions weren’t getting propagated when a section was enabled for new sites, or its Propagation Method was changed. ([#10634](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/10634))

### Security
- Generated control panel URLs now begin with the `@web` alias value if the `baseCpUrl` config setting isn’t defined.
- HTML entities output within email body text are now escaped by default in HTML email bodies.
