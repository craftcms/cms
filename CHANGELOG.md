### Changed
- Craft now requires PHP 8.0.2 or later.
- Craft now requires MySQL 5.7.8 / MariaDB 10.2.7 / PostgreSQL 10.0 or later.
- Craft now requires the [Intl](https://php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php) and [BCMath](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php) PHP extensions.
- Improved draft creation/application performance. ([#10577](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/10577))
- Improved revision creation performance. ([#10589](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/10577))
- The “What’s New” HUD now displays an icon and label above each announcement, identifying where it came from (Craft CMS or a plugin). ([#9747](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/9747))
- The control panel now keeps track of the currently-edited site on a per-tab basis by adding a `site` query string param to all control panel URLs. ([#8920](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/8920))
- Element index pages’ status and sort menu option selections are now coded into the page URL via `status` and `sort` query string params. ([#10669](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/10669))
- Users are no longer required to have a username or email.
- Users can now set their Formatting Locale to any known locale; not just the available Language options. ([#10519](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/10519))
- Users’ Language and Formatting Locale settings now display locale names in the current language and their native languages. ([#10519](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/10519))
- User queries now return all users by default, rather than only active users.
- Filtering users by `active`, `pending`, and `locked` statuses no longer excludes suspended users.
- `credentialed` and `inactive` are now reserved user group handles.
- Elements throughout the control panel are now automatically updated whenever they’re saved by another browser tab.
- Assets fields that are restricted to a single location can now be configured to allow selection within subfolders of that location. ([#9070](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/9070))
- When an image is saved as a new asset from the Image Editor via an Assets field, the Assets field will now automatically replace the selected asset with the new one. ([#8974](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/8974))
- `alt` is now a reserved field handle for volume field layouts.
- Volumes no longer have “types”, and their file operations are now delegated to a filesystem selected by an “Asset Filesystem” setting on the volume.
- Volumes now have “Transform Filesystem” and “Transform Subpath” settings, which can be used to choose where image transforms should be stored. (The volume’s Asset Filesystem will be used by default.)
- Asset thumbnails are now generated as image transforms.
- It’s now possible to create volumes directly from the User Settings page.
- Images that are not web-safe now are always converted to JPEGs when transforming, if no format was specified.
- Entry post dates are no longer set automatically until the entry is validated with the `live` scenario. ([#10093](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/10093))
- Entry queries’ `authorGroup()` param method now accepts an array of `craft\models\UserGroup` objects.
- Element queries’ `revision` params can now be set to `null` to include normal and revision elements.
- Element queries can no longer be traversed or accessed like an array. Use a query execution method such as `all()`, `collect()`, or `one()` to fetch the results before working with them.
- Element queries’ `title` params no longer treat values with commas as arrays. ([#10891](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/10891))
- User queries’ `firstName` and `lastName` params no longer treat values with commas as arrays. ([#10891](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/10891))
- Relational fields now load elements in the current site rather than the primary site, if the source element isn’t localizable. ([#7048](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/7048))
- Lightswitch fields can no longer be marked as required within field layouts. ([#10773](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/10773))
- Built-in queue jobs are now always translated for the current user’s language. ([#9745](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/9745))
- Path options passed to console commands (e.g. `--basePath`) now take precedence over their enivronment variable/PHP constant counterparts.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where pending project config changes in the YAML would get applied when other project config changes were made. ([#9660](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/9660))
- Fixed a bug where revisions weren’t getting propagated when a section was enabled for new sites, or its Propagation Method was changed. ([#10634](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/10634))

### Security
- Generated control panel URLs now begin with the `@web` alias value if the `baseCpUrl` config setting isn’t defined.
- HTML entities output within email body text are now escaped by default in HTML email bodies.
