### Development
- Entry type names and handles must now be unique globally, rather than just within a single section. Existing entry type names and handles will be renamed automatically where needed, to ensure uniqueness.
- Assets, categories, entries, and tags now support eager-loading paths prefixed with a field layout provider’s handle (e.g. `myEntryType:myField`).
- Element queries now have an `eagerly` param, which can be used to lazily eager-load the resulting elements for all peer elements, when `all()`, `collect()`, `one()`, `nth()`, or `count()` is called.
- Element queries now have an `inBulkOp` param, which limits the results to elements which were involved in a bulk operation. ([#14032](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14032))
- Address queries now have `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `addressLine3`, `administrativeArea`, `countryCode`, `dependentLocality`, `firstName`, `fullName`, `lastName`, `locality`, `organizationTaxId`, `organization`, `postalCode`, and `sortingCode` params.
- Entry queries now have `field`, `fieldId`, `primaryOwner`, `primaryOwnerId`, `owner`, `ownerId`, `allowOwnerDrafts`, and `allowOwnerRevisions` params.
- Entry queries’ `authorId` params now support passing multiple IDs prefixed with `and`, to fetch entries with multiple listed authors.
- User queries now have an `authorOf` param.
- Nested addresses are now cached by their field ID, and address queries now register cache tags based on their `field` and `fieldId` params.
- Nested entries are now cached by their field ID, and entry queries now register cache tags based on their `field` and `fieldId` params.
- GraphQL schemas can now include queries and mutations for nested entries (e.g. within Matrix or CKEditor fields) directly. ([#14366](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14366))
- Added the `fieldId`, `fieldHandle`, `ownerId`, and `sortOrder` entry GraphQL fields. ([#14366](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14366))
- Entries’ GraphQL type names are now formatted as `<entryTypeHandle>_Entry`, and are no longer prefixed with their section’s handle. (That goes for Matrix-nested entries as well.)
- Entries now have `author` and `authorIds` GraphQL field.
- Matrix fields’ GraphQL mutation types now expect nested entries to be defined by an `entries` field rather than `blocks`.
- Added the `entryType()` and `fieldValueSql()` Twig functions. ([#14557](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/14557))
- Added the `|firstWhere` and `|flatten` Twig filters.
- Removed the `craft.matrixBlocks()` Twig function. `craft.entries()` should be used instead.

### Extensibility
- Elements now store their content in an `elements_sites.content` column as JSON, rather than across multiple columns in a `content` table.

- Slugs are no longer required on elements that don’t have a URI format.
- Element types’ `fieldLayouts()` and `defineFieldLayouts()` methods’ `$source` arguments must now accept `null` values.
- All element types can now support eager-loading paths prefixed with a field layout provider’s handle (e.g. `myEntryType:myField`), by implementing `craft\base\FieldLayoutProviderInterface` on the field layout provider class, and ensuring that `defineFieldLayouts()` is returning field layouts via their providers.
- All core element query param methods now return `static` instead of `self`. ([#11868](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/11868))
- Migrations that modify the project config no longer need to worry about whether the same changes were already applied to the incoming project config YAML files.
- Selectize menus no longer apply special styling to options with the value `new`. The `_includes/forms/selectize.twig` control panel template should be used instead (or `craft\helpers\Cp::selectizeHtml()`/`selectizeFieldHtml()`), which will append an styled “Add” option when `addOptionFn` and `addOptionLabel` settings are passed. ([#11946](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/11946))

- The `assets/upload` controller action now includes `errors` object in failure responses. ([#12159](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12159))

- Element search scores set on `craft\events\SearchEvent::$scores` by `craft\services\Search::EVENT_AFTER_SEARCH` or `EVENT_BEFORE_SCORE_RESULTS` now must be indexed by element ID and site ID (e.g. `'100-1'`).

### System
- Craft now requires PHP 8.2+.
- Craft now requires MySQL 8.0.17+, MariaDB 10.4.6+, or PostgreSQL 13+.
- Craft now requires the Symfony Filesystem component directly.
- Craft now requires `bacon/bacon-qr-code`.
- Craft now requires `composer/semver` directly.
- Craft now requires `pragmarx/google2fa`.
- Craft now requires `pragmarx/recovery`.

- New database tables now default to the `utf8mb4` charset, and the `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` or `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` collation, on MySQL. Existing installs should run `db/convert-charset` after upgrading, to ensure all tables have consistent charsets and collations. ([#11823](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/11823))
- The `deprecationerrors.traces`, `fieldlayouts.config`, `gqlschemas.scope`, `sections.previewTargets`, `userpreferences.preferences`, and `widgets.settings` columns are now of type `JSON` for MySQL and PostgreSQL. ([#14300](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14300))
- The `defaultTemplateExtensions` config setting now lists `twig` before `html` by default. ([#11809](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/11809))
- Improved the initial page load performance for element edit screens that contain Matrix fields.
- Improved the performance of control panel screens that include field layout designers.
- Improved the performance of autosaves for elements with newly-created Matrix entries.
- Slugs are no longer required for elements that don’t have a URI format that contains `slug`.
- Garbage collection now deletes orphaned nested entries.
- Craft now has a default limit of 100 sites, which can be increased via `craft\ervices\Sites::$maxSites` at your own peril. ([#14307](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14307))
- Fixed a bug where multi-site element queries weren’t scoring elements on a per-site basis. ([#13801](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/13801))

- Added an SVG icon set based on Font Awesome 6.5.1. ([#14169](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14169))
