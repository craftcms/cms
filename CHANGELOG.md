### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where pending project config changes in the YAML would get applied when other project config changes were made. ([#9660](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/9660))
- Fixed a bug where revisions weren’t getting propagated when a section was enabled for new sites, or its Propagation Method was changed. ([#10634](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/10634))

### Security
- Generated control panel URLs now begin with the `@web` alias value if the `baseCpUrl` config setting isn’t defined.
- HTML entities output within email body text are now escaped by default in HTML email bodies.
