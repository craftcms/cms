### User Management

- Users with more than 50 addresses will now display them as a paginated element index.

- The login modal and elevated session modal have been redesigned to be consistent with the login page.
- User sessions are now treated as elevated immediately after login, per the `elevatedSessionDuration` config setting.

- Matrix fields now manage nested entries, rather than Matrix blocks. During the upgrade, existing Matrix block types will be converted to entry types; their nested fields will be made global; and Matrix blocks will be converted to entries.
- Matrix fields now have “Entry URI Format” and “Template” settings for each site.
- Matrix fields now have a “View Mode” setting, giving admins the choice to display nested entries as cards, inline-editable blocks, or an embedded element index.

- Removed the concept of field groups.
- `entrify/*` commands now ask if an entry type already exists for the section.

- The `up`, `migrate/up`, and `migrate/all` commands no longer overwrite pending project config YAML changes, if new project config changes were made by migrations.
- Removed the `resave/matrix-blocks` command.

### Development
- Entry type names and handles must now be unique globally, rather than just within a single section. Existing entry type names and handles will be renamed automatically where needed, to ensure uniqueness.
- Assets, categories, entries, and tags now support eager-loading paths prefixed with a field layout provider’s handle (e.g. `myEntryType:myField`).
- Element queries now have an `eagerly` param, which can be used to lazily eager-load the resulting elements for all peer elements, when `all()`, `collect()`, `one()`, `nth()`, or `count()` is called.
- Element queries now have an `inBulkOp` param, which limits the results to elements which were involved in a bulk operation. ([#14032](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14032))
- Address queries now have `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `administrativeArea`, `countryCode`, `dependentLocality`, `firstName`, `fullName`, `lastName`, `locality`, `organizationTaxId`, `organization`, `postalCode`, and `sortingCode` params.
- Entry queries now have `field`, `fieldId`, `primaryOwner`, `primaryOwnerId`, `owner`, `ownerId`, `allowOwnerDrafts`, and `allowOwnerRevisions` params.
- Entries’ GraphQL type names are now formatted as `<entryTypeHandle>_Entry`, and are no longer prefixed with their section’s handle. (That goes for Matrix-nested entries as well.)
- Matrix fields’ GraphQL mutation types now expect nested entries to be defined by an `entries` field rather than `blocks`.
- Added the `|firstWhere` and `|flatten` Twig filters.
- Removed the `craft.matrixBlocks()` Twig function. `craft.entries()` should be used instead.
- Controller actions which require a `POST` request will now respond with a 405 error code if another request method is used. ([#13397](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/13397))

### Extensibility
- Elements now store their content in an `elements_sites.content` column as JSON, rather than across multiple columns in a `content` table. ([#2009](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/2009), [#4308](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/4308), [#7221](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/7221), [#7750](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/7750), [#12954](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12954))
- Slugs are no longer required on elements that don’t have a URI format.
- Element types’ `fieldLayouts()` and `defineFieldLayouts()` methods’ `$source` arguments must now accept `null` values.
- All element types can now support eager-loading paths prefixed with a field layout provider’s handle (e.g. `myEntryType:myField`), by implementing `craft\base\FieldLayoutProviderInterface` on the field layout provider class, and ensuring that `defineFieldLayouts()` is returning field layouts via their providers.
- All core element query param methods now return `static` instead of `self`. ([#11868](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/11868))
- Migrations that modify the project config no longer need to worry about whether the same changes were already applied to the incoming project config YAML files.
- Selectize menus no longer apply special styling to options with the value `new`. The `_includes/forms/selectize.twig` control panel template should be used instead (or `craft\helpers\Cp::selectizeHtml()`/`selectizeFieldHtml()`), which will append an styled “Add” option when `addOptionFn` and `addOptionLabel` settings are passed. ([#11946](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/11946))
- Added the `disclosureMenu()`, `elementCard()`, `elementChip()`, `elementIndex()`, and `siteMenuItems()` global functions for control panel templates.
- The `assets/move-asset` and `assets/move-folder` actions no longer include `success` keys in responses. ([#12159](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12159))
- The `assets/upload` controller action now includes `errors` object in failure responses. ([#12159](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12159))

### System
- Craft now requires PHP 8.2 or later.
- Craft now requires the Symfony Filesystem component directly.
- Craft now requires `bacon/bacon-qr-code`.
- Craft now requires `composer/semver` directly.
- Craft now requires `pragmarx/google2fa`.
- Craft now requires `pragmarx/recovery`.

Existing installs should run `db/convert-charset` after upgrading, to ensure all tables have consistent charsets and collations. ([#11823](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/11823))
- The `defaultTemplateExtensions` config setting now lists `twig` before `html` by default. ([#11809](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/11809))
- Improved the initial page load performance for element edit pages that contain Matrix fields.
- Improved the performance of autosaves for elements with newly-created Matrix entries.
- Slugs are no longer required for elements that don’t have a URI format that contains `slug`.
