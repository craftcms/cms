- Fixed a JavaScript error that occurred when selecting images from Rich Text fields.
- Fixed a bug where Redactor toolbars weren’t showing up on page load in some browsers.
- Fixed a bug where the “Select transform” button was missing from asset selection modals launched from Rich Text fields.
- Fixed a bug where the “Search in subfolders” checkbox was not showing up when searching in asset sources that had subfolders.
- Fixed a bug where Date/Time fields that were set to show both Date and Time inputs were not displaying those inputs inline together.
- Fixed a z-index issue that affected time-pickers within Date/Time fields within modal windows.
- Fixed a bug where the “Save” and “Cancel” buttons on inline element creation modals could get cut off for elements that didn’t have any/many custom fields.
- Fixed a potential bug where plugin migrations would not get run if a plugin update had been released pre-Craft 2.5 with new migrations, but the update was not installed until after the site had been updated to Craft 2.5.
- Fixed a bug where customizations to element type sources were not getting applied to element selector modals when specific sources were not requested.

- The Dashboard has been rebuilt, bringing all widget administration functions right onto the main Dashboard page, including the ability to add, edit, reorder, resize, and delete widgets.
- It’s now possible to create new entries right from Entry Selector Modals (like the ones used by Entries fields).
- It’s now possible to create new categories right from Category Selector Modals (like the ones used by Categories fields).

- It’s now possible to customize the table columns for each element source.
- Asset indexes now have the option to show table columns for File Kind, Image Size, Image Width, Image Height, ID, Date Created, Date Updated, and certain custom fields.
- Category indexes now have the option to show table columns for Link, ID, Date Created, Date Updated, and certain custom fields.

- Added a “View Mode” setting to Assets fields, with “List” and “Large Thumbnails” options.
- Added an “Admins” source to the Users index.
- Added a new “Site Icon” field to Settings → General, where admins can upload an icon image that will appear to the left of the site’s name in the global sidebar.

- Added a “Plugins” section to the Settings index page, which has links to plugins’ settings pages.
- The Updates page now shows available plugin updates, for plugins that provide a release feed.
- The Updates page now shows the release date each release was… released.
- Craft now uses the image optimization technique [recommended by Dave Newton](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/06/efficient-image-resizing-with-imagemagick/) when ImageMagick is installed, resulting in a significant reduction in file sizes, without a noticeable effect on quality.
- Added support for uploading assets as data URLs in entry forms, using an input with a name formatted like `fields[myAssetsField][data][]`. It’s also possible to specify the filename, using an input with a name formatted like `fields[myAssetsField][filenames][]`.
- It is now possible to customize the behavior of search terms when setting an element criteria’s `search` param, by setting it to an array rather than just the search query string (e.g. `.search({query: "foo", subRight: true})`).
- Element queries that include the `search` param will now set a `searchScore` attribute on all of the resulting elements.
- It’s now possible to query for elements that are related to _all_ of a given set of elements, by beginning a `relatedTo` param’s `element`, `targetElement`, or `sourceElement` sub-param with `'and'` (e.g. `relatedTo: {elements: ['and', 1, 2, 3]}`).
- It’s now possible to find elements where a Matrix field does/doesn’t have any blocks, by passing `':notempty:'` or `':empty:'` onto the field’s `ElementCriteriaModel` parameter (e.g. `craft.entries.myMatrixField(':notempty:')`).
- It’s now possible to find elements where a relational field does/doesn’t have any related elements, by passing `':notempty:'` or `':empty:'` onto the field’s `ElementCriteriaModel` parameter (e.g. `craft.entries.myEntriesField(':notempty:')`).

- Added the `|values` Twig filter, for getting an array of all the values in the passed-in array, with reset keys.
- Plugins now have “schema versions”, defined by a `getSchemaVersion()` method on the primary plugin class. Schema versions are now the determining factor in whether the site should go into Maintenance Mode when a plugin is updated, until someone runs the plugin’s migrations from the Control Panel. If a plugin’s version number changes but its schema version doesn’t, Craft will silently update its record of the plugin’s version number and get on with the request.
- Plugins can now provide the URL to their documentation via a `getDocumentationUrl()` method on the primary plugin class.
- Plugins’ updates can now be included in Craft’s update notifications, and on the Updates page in the Control Panel, by creating a JSON feed that describes the plugin’s releases, and returning the URL to it from a `getReleaseFeedUrl()` method on the primary plugin class.
- Plugins can now provide descriptions of themselves via a `getDescription()` method on the primary plugin class.
- Plugins can now explicitly declare whether or not they have settings, via the new `hasSettings()` method on the primary plugin class. By default, the method will call the plugin’s [getSettings()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/etc/plugins/IPlugin#getSettings-detail) method, and return whether that came back with anything.
- Plugins can now have icons, by saving an “icon.svg” file within their `resources/` subfolder.
- Plugins with Control Panel sections can customize their icon in the global sidebar by placing an “icon-mask.svg” file within their `resources/` subfolder.
- Plugins can now prevent themselves from being installed by returning `false` from their [onBeforeInstall()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/etc/plugins/IPlugin#onBeforeInstall-detail) method.
- Added `IWidget::getMaxColspan()` (replacing `getColspan()`), for specifying the maximum number of columns the widget is allowed to span across.
- Added `IWidget::getIconPath()`, for specifying the path to the widget’s icon SVG.
- Element types’ [getSources()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/elementtypes/IElementType#getSources-detail) methods can now include a `status` property within the source config arrays they return, which will give the source a status icon using the specified class name.
- Added [IElementType::defineAvailableTableAttributes()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/elementtypes/IElementType#defineAvailableTableAttributes-detail), replacing the now-deprecated `defineTableAttributes()`.

- Added [IOHelper::getFileKindLabel()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/helpers/IOHelper#getFileKindLabel-detail).
- Added [StringHelper::encodeMb4()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/helpers/StringHelper#encodeMb4-detail), for encoding 4-byte UTF-8 characters to avoid MySQL 3-byte character restraints.
- Added [StringHelper::parseMarkdownLine()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/helpers/StringHelper#parseMarkdownLine-detail), for formatting a single line of Markdown code, without wrapping the text in a `<p>` tag.
- Added [StringHelper::toCamelCase()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/helpers/StringHelper#toCamelCase-detail), for formatting a string in camelCase.
- Added [StringHelper::toPascalCase()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/helpers/StringHelper#toPascalCase-detail), for formatting a string in `PascalCase`.
- Added [StringHelper::toSnakeCase()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/helpers/StringHelper#toSnakeCase-detail), for formatting a string in `snake_case`.
- Added [ErrorHandler::logException()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/etc/errors/ErrorHandler#logException-detail).
- Added [FieldsService::getOrderedFieldLayoutFieldsById()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/services/FieldsService#getOrderedFieldLayoutFieldsById-detail).
- Added a `$localeId` argument to [UrlHelper::getSiteUrl()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/helpers/UrlHelper#getSiteUrl-detail) (and the corresponding `siteUrl()` template function), which can be set to a locale ID to generate a URL relative to that locale’s base site URL.
- Added a `$justIds` argument to [ElementsService::buildElementsQuery()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/services/ElementsService#buildElementsQuery-detail), which tells it to only include the `elements.id` column in the SELECT clause of the returned query.

- Added `craft.request.isGet`, for determining if it’s a GET request.
- Added `craft.request.isPost`, for determining if it’s a POST request.
- Added `craft.request.isDelete`, for determining if it’s a DELETE request.
- Added `craft.request.isPut`, for determining if it’s a PUT request.
- The `checkboxField` macro in `_includes/forms.html` now checks for a `fieldLabel` param, which will cause it to output using the same field container HTML as other field macros, using the `fieldLabel` param as the main field label. (The `label` param, if it exists, will still be used to define the actual text label that should appear beside the checkbox.)
- The `checkboxSelect` and `checkboxSelectField` macros in `_includes/forms.html` now support an `includeAllOption` parameter, which can be set to `false` if you don’t want the “All” checkbox to be included in the resulting list of checkboxes.

- Control Panel templates can now set `fullPageForm = true` to wrap the entire page (sans global sidebar) in a `<form>`. A “Save” button will also appear in the page header by default, which can be overridden by extending the `saveButton` block.
- Control Panel templates can now define sub navigations via a `subnav` variable, and can identify the currently selected page via a `selectedSubnavItem` variable.
- Control Panel templates can now add a `meta` class to divs that contain fields, and the fields will be displayed in a new layout optimized for metadata-type fields.
- Control Panel templates can now contain multiple related field inputs in a div with a `flex` class, which will get them to be displayed alongside each other in a single row.
- Added `_includes/nav.html` for creating navigation menus.
- The Control Panel now includes [Selectize.js](https://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/). Dropdown and multi-select menu containers can include the `selectize` class and be automatically replaced by Selectize inputs.
- Objects that extend `Garnish.Base` now automatically trigger a `destroy` event when their `destroy()` method is called.
- The `Craft.BaseElementIndex` class now has an `onAppendElements` event that is triggered when new elements are lazy-loaded onto an existing element view.

- Added the [defaultWeekStartDay](https://craftcms.com/docs/config-settings#defaultWeekStartDay) config setting, which defines the default Week Start Day for new users.
- Added the [preserveImageColorProfiles](https://craftcms.com/docs/config-settings#preserveImageColorProfiles) config setting, which prevents Craft from optimizing image color profiles on upload.
- Rich Text fields now encode 4-byte UTF-8 characters (like emojis), allowing them to be saved without causing a MySQL error due to 3-byte character restraints.
- Included the [Source Code](https://imperavi.com/redactor/plugins/source/) plugin for Redactor II.

- Rich Text fields now get the same blue glow style that other text fields get when focused.
- Swapped the previous element resize detection script out for [element-resize-detector](https://github.com/wnr/element-resize-detector), fixing some JS errors and improving cross-browser compatibility.

- It is now possible to customize the name of the page info variable that gets defined by the `{% paginate %}` tag (e.g. `{% paginate craft.entries as pageInfo, pageEntries %}`). (The variable is still called `paginate` by default.)
- The `|replace` filter now supports regular expression modifiers.
- Prevented “1052 Column 'id' in order clause is ambiguous” MySQL errors from occurring on element queries where the `order` param is set to “id” rather than “elements.id”.
- [ElementsService::buildElementsQuery()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/services/ElementsService#buildElementsQuery-detail) now applies the `order`, `limit`, and `offset` element criteria parameters to the resulting query object.
- [UserSessionService::getIsStarted()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/services/UserSessionService#getIsStarted-detail) now uses [session_status()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.session-status.php) to determine if the session has started for servers running PHP 5.4 or later.
- [StringHelper::normalizeKeywords()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/helpers/StringHelper#normalizeKeywords-detail) now removes HTML entities from the passed-in string, rather than decoding them.
- [FieldsService::assembleLayout()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/services/FieldsService#assembleLayout-detail) no longer requires the second parameter to be passed in.

## 2.3.2639 - 2015-03-11

### Added
- Added the [useSecureCookies](https://craftcms.com/docs/config-settings#useSecureCookies) config setting, which determines whether Craft should set the secure flag on its cookies. (Default value is `auto`, which is resolved depending on whether the current request is over SSL).
- Added [HtmlHelper::encodeParams()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/helpers/HtmlHelper#encodeParams-detail), for concatenating HTML strings and dynamic, untrusted strings together.

### Changed
- Improved the cryptographic strength of user verification codes, user session tokens, as well as the tokens used in entry draft/version Share URLs.
- All Control Panel requests are now served with a `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` header, which prevents browsers from rendering the Control Panel within an iframe.
- Password Reset emails now always link to the Control Panel for users that have access to it, even if requested from a front-end form.

### Security
- Improved CSRF token security, especially for logged-in users, reducing the risk of a man-in-the-middle attack.
- All Control Panel requests are now served with a `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header, which fixes some XSS attack vectors in IE/Ajax requests.
- [FeedsService::getFeedItems()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/services/FeedsService#getFeedItems-detail) now ignores feed items with invalid permalink URLs, which fixes an XSS attack vector.
- The `|json_encode` Twig filter now passes the options `JSON_HEX_TAG|JSON_HEX_AMP|JSON_HEX_QUOT` to PHP’s [json_encode()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php) function by default on HTML/XHTML requests, which fixes some XSS attack vectors.
- Fixed other possible XSS attack vectors with the help of [HtmlHelper::encodeParams()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/helpers/HtmlHelper#encodeParams-detail).
- Fixed a possible attack vector where a user could use a timing attack on a stale session to figure out the new PHP session ID’s value.

- [BaseModel::setAttributes()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/models/BaseModel#setAttributes-detail) (and methods that call it, like [BaseModel::populateModel()](https://craftcms.com/classreference/models/BaseModel#populateModel-detail)) will now copy any _eager-loaded_ relations from passed-in records. (Meaning, if that’s the behavior you want you need to make use of [`with()`](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/1.1/CActiveRecord#with-detail) when loading the records).
- The default Homepage single no longer has a custom “Heading” field. Now it just shows a dynamic Title field instead.

- Fixed a bug where the Name and Instructions settings were appearing to be required even though they weren’t, for unsaved Matrix block type fields.
- Fixed a bug where validation errors for Matrix block type fields that didn’t have Names would refer to the field as “\__blank__”. Now the field handle is used instead.
- Fixed a bug where [WebApp](https://craftcms.com/classreference/etc/web/WebApp) was getting initialized with config settings for `fieldTypes` and `file` components that don’t actually exist.

## 2.3.2616 - 2014-12-03

- Added support for a “compressed” asset file kind which includes common compression file formats such as .zip and .tar.

- Refactored [ProfileLogRoute](http://buildwithcraft.com/classreference/etc/logging/ProfileLogRoute) and [WebLogRoute](http://buildwithcraft.com/classreference/etc/logging/WebLogRoute).
- [UserModel::__toString()](http://buildwithcraft.com/classreference/models/UserModel#__toString-detail) now outputs the user’s email address, regardless of whether their username has been updated to match it, if the [useEmailAsUsername](http://buildwithcraft.com/docs/config-settings#useEmailAsUsername) config setting is enabled.
- [UserSessionService](http://buildwithcraft.com/classreference/services/UserSessionService) will not extend the user session if a `dontExtendSession` param exists on the request, either in the query string or POST data.

## 1.3.2487 - 2014-02-13

### Added
- The search syntax now supports using asterisks in combination with double colons, for fuzzy searching against an attribute’s full value. For example, a search for “`title::a*`” will give you entries where the *entire* title begins with `a`, not just any word within the title.

(This time we mean it!)
- Fixed a bug where integer-only Number fields could get a false validation error when submitting an integer from a locale that uses a non-comma group symbol (e.g. 1.000 in German).
- Fixed a MySQL error that could occur when saving a Matrix field, if one of its sub-fields had been renamed, and a new sub-field was created with the other’s original name, at the same time.
- Fixed a bug where you couldn’t delete a field if it used a custom field type provided by a plugin that was no longer installed.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where if a Matrix field had two block type fields with the same handle, only the last one saved would ever be able to remember its content values.

- Element index pages and selection modals are now exponentially faster than they used to be.
- The Get Help widget is no longer available to non-admins.
- Image transforms are now ordered by name.
- You can now treat [ElementCriteriaModel](http://buildwithcraft.com/docs/templating/elementcriteriamodel) objects as if they were arrays, without calling `find()`.
- Entries, Assets, Users, and Tags fields now return [ElementCriteriaModel](http://buildwithcraft.com/docs/templating/elementcriteriamodel) objects when you access their field values in the templates, so you can append additional parameters onto them before looping through them if you want, or use the `first()`, `last()`, and `ids()` [output functions](http://buildwithcraft.com/docs/templating/elementcriteriamodel#outputting-elements).
- Made it possible to order elements by their relational field-defined order in some cases, by setting the `order` param to “sortOrder”.
- Element content is now loaded up front when fetching elements, reducing the number of SQL queries and page load time on most pages.
- The `dateCreated`, `dateUpdated`, `postDate`, and Date field params now support prefixing the values with “<”, “>”, “<=”, or “>=”.
- Field column names in the craft\_content DB table are now prefixed with “field\_” so they’re easier to distinguish from Craft’s core schema.
- Outputting an `AssetFileModel` with a transform set (e.g. `{{ myAsset.myTransform }}`) now outputs the transform’s URL rather than the asset’s title.
- Craft now looks for translation files that match the target locale’s language in addition to translation files that match the full locale. For example, the `fr\_ca` locale will now load both `craft/translations/fr.php` and `fr_ca.php`.
- The `activateAccountFailurePath`, `activateAccountSuccessPath`, `loginPath`, `logoutPath`, `setPasswordPath`, and `setPasswordSuccessPath` config settings are now localizable, by setting them to an array of paths (indexed by locale ID) rather than a single path. The first path listed will always act as the default if an exact locale match cannot be found.

- The Get Help widget now accepts file attachments.
- Field names are now properly escaped in the CP.
- Assets of an unknown kind now get their Kind value set to “unknown” rather than null.

- Console logs and profile data are no longer appended to non-`.html`/`.twig` template requests when in Dev Mode.
- `TemplatesService::namespaceInputs()` no longer requires the `$namespace` argument.
- `FieldsService::saveField()` has a new `$validate` argument which defaults to `true`.
- Field type, asset source type, and widget settings are now output within a `{% namespace %}` tag pair, so the namespace is available to the classes’ `getSettingsHtml()` methods via `craft()->templates->getNamespace()`.
- `_includes/forms/editableTable.html` no longer uses `jsId` and `jsName` variables; the JS-facing input ID and name attributes are now auto-generated based on the `id` and `name` variables, taking the active template namespace into account.
- `BaseModel::defineAttributes()` is no longer abstract, and thus no longer required by classes that extend it.
- `BaseSavableComponentType::setSettings()` now accepts a `BaseModel` instance, which completely replaces the internally stored settings object, rather than just calling `setAttributes()` on it.
- `ElementsService::findElements()` now returns an empty array right away if the `ElementCriteriaModel`’s `id` param is set to `false`.
- `ArrayHelper::stringToArray()` now converts `ArrayObject` instances to normal arrays.
- Craft now uses the `namespace` tag to wrap namespace field inputs, so the namespace is available via `TemplatesService::getNamespace()`, et al.
- `FieldsService::saveField()` now saves the old field handle on the `FieldModel` via a new `oldHandle` attribute.
- Added more strings to the default list of translations available to Javascript.
- The Quick Post widget is now using JS buffering to capture widget JS, rather than the old hacky way.
- Changed the way Rich Text fields get initialized.
- Moved `columnExists()` from `MysqlSchema` to `DbConnection`.
- Got rid of `AttributeType::Version` and `AttributeType::Build`.
- Gutted everything in the `RelationsService` except for `saveRelations()`, as nothing else is necessary anymore.
- `BaseInputGenerator` (JS) now triggers a `textchange` event after updating the target field’s value.
- `BaseElementType::defineTableAttributes()` should now just return an array in which the keys are the attribute to be sorted by, and the values are the table headings.
- `BaseElementType::isTranslatable()` has been renamed to `isLocalized()`.
- `ContentModel`’s locale attribute now defaults to the primary site locale.
- `DbHelper::parseDateParam()` no longer accepts an `$operator` argument, since the operator can now be set directly on the `$value`.
- All built-in field types are now using `prepValueFromPost()` rather than the deprecated `prepPostData()` function.
- Updated Twig to 1.14.2.
- Updated Guzzle to 3.7.4.
- Updated PHPUnit to 3.7.28.
- Updated Redactor to 9.1.6.
- Updated jQuery Timepicker to 1.2.9.

### Deprecated
- Deprecated `BaseElementModel::getRawContent()` in favor of `getContent()->getAttribute()`.

### Removed
- Removed the free disk space requirement, since some hosts allocate disk space on demand. And then they sell out to GoDaddy.
