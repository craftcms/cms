### Development
- Entry type names and handles must now be unique globally, rather than just within a single section. Existing entry type names and handles will be renamed automatically where needed, to ensure uniqueness.
- Assets, categories, entries, and tags now support eager-loading paths prefixed with a field layout provider’s handle (e.g. `myEntryType:myField`).
- Element queries now have an `eagerly` param, which can be used to lazily eager-load the resulting elements for all peer elements, when `all()`, `collect()`, `one()`, `nth()`, or `count()` is called.
- Element queries now have an `inBulkOp` param, which limits the results to elements which were involved in a bulk operation. ([#14032](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14032))
- Address queries now have `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `addressLine3`, `administrativeArea`, `countryCode`, `dependentLocality`, `firstName`, `fullName`, `lastName`, `locality`, `organizationTaxId`, `organization`, `postalCode`, and `sortingCode` params.
- Entry queries now have `field`, `fieldId`, `primaryOwner`, `primaryOwnerId`, `owner`, `ownerId`, `allowOwnerDrafts`, and `allowOwnerRevisions` params.
- Entry queries’ `authorId` params now support passing multiple IDs prefixed with `and`, to fetch entries with multiple listed authors.
- User queries now have an `authorOf` param.
- Nested addresses are now cached by their field ID, and address queries now register cache tags based on their `field` and `fieldId` params.
- Nested entries are now cached by their field ID, and entry queries now register cache tags based on their `field` and `fieldId` params.
- GraphQL schemas can now include queries and mutations for nested entries (e.g. within Matrix or CKEditor fields) directly. ([#14366](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14366))
- Added the `fieldId`, `fieldHandle`, `ownerId`, and `sortOrder` entry GraphQL fields. ([#14366](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/14366))
- Entries’ GraphQL type names are now formatted as `<entryTypeHandle>_Entry`, and are no longer prefixed with their section’s handle. (That goes for Matrix-nested entries as well.)
- Entries now have `author` and `authorIds` GraphQL field.
- Matrix fields’ GraphQL mutation types now expect nested entries to be defined by an `entries` field rather than `blocks`.
- Added the `entryType()` and `fieldValueSql()` Twig functions. ([#14557](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/14557))
- Added the `|firstWhere` and `|flatten` Twig filters.
- Removed the `craft.matrixBlocks()` Twig function. `craft.entries()` should be used instead.
- Controller actions which require a `POST` request will now respond with a 405 error code if another request method is used. ([#13397](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/13397))

### Extensibility
- Elements now store their content in an `elements_sites.content` column as JSON, rather than across multiple columns in a `content` table. ([#2009](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/2009), [#4308](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/4308), [#7221](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/7221), [#7750](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/7750), [#12954](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12954))
- Slugs are no longer required on elements that don’t have a URI format.
- Element types’ `fieldLayouts()` and `defineFieldLayouts()` methods’ `$source` arguments must now accept `null` values.
- All element types can now support eager-loading paths prefixed with a field layout provider’s handle (e.g. `myEntryType:myField`), by implementing `craft\base\FieldLayoutProviderInterface` on the field layout provider class, and ensuring that `defineFieldLayouts()` is returning field layouts via their providers.
- All core element query param methods now return `static` instead of `self`. ([#11868](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/11868))
- Migrations that modify the project config no longer need to worry about whether the same changes were already applied to the incoming project config YAML files.
- Selectize menus no longer apply special styling to options with the value `new`. The `_includes/forms/selectize.twig` control panel template should be used instead (or `craft\helpers\Cp::selectizeHtml()`/`selectizeFieldHtml()`), which will append an styled “Add” option when `addOptionFn` and `addOptionLabel` settings are passed. ([#11946](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/11946))
- Added the `chip()`, `customSelect()`, `disclosureMenu()`, `elementCard()`, `elementChip()`, `elementIndex()`, `iconSvg()`, and `siteMenuItems()` global functions for control panel templates.

- Craft now requires MySQL 8.0.17+, MariaDB 10.4.6+, or PostgreSQL 13+.
- Craft now requires the Symfony Filesystem component directly.
- Craft now requires `bacon/bacon-qr-code`.
- Craft now requires `composer/semver` directly.
- Craft now requires `pragmarx/google2fa`.
