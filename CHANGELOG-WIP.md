# Release Notes for Craft CMS 4.4 (WIP)

### Content Management

- Asset indexes now display the current subfolder path above the element listing. ([#12558](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12558))
- It’s now possible to move volume folders and assets to a new location via a new “Move…” bulk element action, rather than via drag-and-drop interactions. ([#12558](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12558))
- It’s now possible to sort asset indexes by image width and height. ([#12653](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12653))

- Entries with more than 10 revisions now include a “View all revisions” item within their revision menu, which links to a new revisions index page for the entry that paginates through all its revisions. ([#8609](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/8609))

- All assets now get thumbnails in the control panel, even if they don’t have a transform filesystem with a base URL. ([#12531](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12531))

### Administration
- Conditional layout components are now identified using a condition icon within field layout designers. ([#12250](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12250))

- Added the `{% dump %}` tag, which dumps variables into a new “Dumps” Debug Toolbar panel. ([#12506](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12506))
- The `dump()` Twig function now utilizes `Craft::dump()`, and no longer requires Dev Mode to be active. ([#12486](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12486), [#12479](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/12479))
- The `{% dd %}` Twig tag can now output the entire `context` array, if no variable is passed to it. ([#12486](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12486))
