# Release Notes for Craft CMS 4.5 (WIP)

### Content Management
- Element slideouts now show their sidebar content full-screen for elements without a field layout, rather than having an empty body. ([#13056](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/13056), [#13053](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13053))
- Relational fields no longer track the previously-selected element(s) when something outside the field is clicked on. ([#13123](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13123))
- Element indexes now use field layouts’ overridden field labels, if all field layouts associated with an element source use the same label. ([#8903](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/8903))

### Accessibility
- Image assets’ thumbnails and `<img>` tags generated via `craft\element\Asset::getImg()` no longer use the assets’ titles as `alt` fallback values. ([#12854](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12854))
- Element index pages now have visually-hidden “Sources” headings for screen readers. ([#12961](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12961))
- Element metadata fields now have visually-hidden “Metadata” headings for screen readers. ([#12961](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12961))
- Structure elements within element indexes now convey their levels to screen readers. ([#13020](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/13020))
- Non-image asset thumbnails in the control panel now have `alt` attributes set to the file extension. ([#12724](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12724))
- Improved copy-text buttons for screen readers. ([#13073](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/13073))

### Administration
- The “My Account” page no longer shows a “Require a password reset on next login” checkbox.

### Development
- Added a new `_globals` global Twig variable for front-end templates, which can be used to store custom values in a global scope. ([#13050](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/13050), [#12951](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/12951))
- The `|replace` Twig filter now supports passing in a hash with regular expression keys. ([#12956](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12956))
- `{% exit %}` tags now support passing a message after the status code. ([#13166](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/13166))
- Elements now include custom field values when being iterated over, and when being merged. ([#13009](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13009))
- Dropdown and Radio Buttons fields now have a “Column Type” setting, which will be set to `varchar` for existing fields, and defaults to “Automatic” for new fields. ([#13025](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/13025), [#12954](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12954))

### Extensibility
- When applying a draft, the canonical elements’ `getDirtyAttributes()` and `getDirtyFields()` methods now return the attribute names and field handles that were modified on the draft for save events. ([#12967](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12967))
- Added `craft\base\ElementInterface::setDirtyFields()`.
- Added `craft\base\ElementInterface::setFieldValueFromRequest()`. ([#12935](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12935))
- Added `craft\base\FieldInterface::normalizeValueFromRequest()`. ([#12935](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12935))
- Added `craft\helpers\StringHelper::escapeShortcodes()`. ([#12935](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12935))
- Added `craft\helpers\StringHelper::unescapeShortcodes()`. ([#12935](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12935))
- Added `craft\web\CpScreenResponseBehavior::$pageSidebar`, `pageSidebar()`, and `pageSidebarTemplate()`. ([#13019](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/13019), [#12795](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12795))
- Added `craft\web\CpScreenResponseBehavior::$slideoutBodyClass`.
- `craft\validators\UniqueValidator` now supports setting an additional filter via the `filter` property. ([#12941](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12941))
- `craft\web\UrlManager` no longer triggers its `EVENT_REGISTER_CP_URL_RULES` and `EVENT_REGISTER_SITE_URL_RULES` events until the request is ready to be routed, making it safe to call `UrlManager::addRules()` from plugin/module constructors. ([#13109](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/13109))
- Deprecated `craft\helpers\UrlHelper::buildQuery()`. `http_build_query()` should be used instead.

### System
- All generated URL param characters are now properly encoded. ([#12796](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12796))
- `migrate` commands besides `migrate/create` no longer create the migration directory if it doesn’t exist yet. ([#12732](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12732))
- When `content` table columns are resized, if any existing values are too long, all column data is now backed up into a new table, and the overflowing values are set to `null`. ([#13025](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/13025))
- When `content` table columns are renamed, if an existing column with the same name already exists, the original column data is now backed up into a new table and then deleted from the `content` table. ([#13025](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/13025))
- Fixed a bug where Plain Text and Table fields were converting posted shortcode-looking strings to emoji. ([#12935](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12935))
