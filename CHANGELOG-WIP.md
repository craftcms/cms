# Release Notes for Craft CMS 5.3 (WIP)

### Content Management
- “Replace file” actions now display success notices on complete. ([#15217](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/15217))

### Accessibility
- Improved the accessibility of two-step verification setup. ([#15229](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/15229))

### Administration
- Icon fields now have an “Include Pro icons” setting, which determines whether Font Awesome Pro icon should be selectable. ([#15242](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/15242))

### Extensibility
- `Craft.ElementEditor` now triggers a `checkActivity` event each time author activity is fetched. ([#15237](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/15237))
- Added `Garnish.once()`, for handling a class-level event only once.
