# Release Notes for Craft CMS 4.4 (WIP)

- Element index pages now track the search term in a query param, so the results can be shared. ([#8942](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/8942), [#12399](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12399))
- Entries with more than 10 revisions now include a “View all revisions” item within their revision menu, which links to a new revisions index page for the entry that paginates through all its revisions. ([#8609](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/8609))

- Dropdown fields that don’t have a blank option and are missing a value will now include and select a blank option at the beginning of their menu. ([#12235](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/12235))

### Administration
- Conditional layout components are now identified using a condition icon within field layout designers. ([#12250](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/12250))

- The `plugin/install`, `plugin/uninstall`, `plugin/enable`, and `plugin/disabled` commands now support an `--all` option, which applies the action to all applicable Composer-installed plugins. ([#11373](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/11373), [#12218](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12218))
- Added the `users/unlock` console command. ([#12345](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/12345))

- Added the `editable` and `savable` asset query params. ([#12266](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12266))

- The `dump()` Twig function now utilizes `Craft::dump()`, and no longer requires Dev Mode to be active. ([#12486](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12486), [#12479](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/12479))
- The `{% dd %}` Twig tag can now output the entire `context` array, if no variable is passed to it. ([#12486](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/12486))

- `Craft::dump()` now has a `$return` argument, which will cause the resulting dump to be returned as a string rather than output, if `true`.
